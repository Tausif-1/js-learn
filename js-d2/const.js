// constanr :- it means a value is assigned it cannot be change.

//for making constant we use [const]

// ex:--

// const pi = 3.14;   //pls uncomment this code to check the code .
// console.log(pi);

//it runs successfully .

//what if we try to change the value of pi ?

const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.15;
console.log(pi);

// it shows error because in constant we cannot the value of pi.
