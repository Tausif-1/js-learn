// null :- it means nothing .

// ex:--

let myVar = null;
console.log(myVar);

// it shows null.

// if we check typeof of null 

console.log(typeof null);

// it shows an object and it is a bug in js .
// it cannot be fixed because lot of programms are written in this code if it fixes lots of programs have to change so ecma decides to keep that bug.
